# Baby Sleeping Tracking App
## Overview
We are creating a cross-platform mobile app in which parents of 0-6 year olds will be able to (1) track their sleeping habits and related events, (2) communicate with their sleep coach, (3) store and share baby information, and (4) view their baby’s sleep plan. Additionally, we will create a web-based interface for sleep coaches to (5) manage their clients profiles, (6) view baby information, and (7) add new sleep plans to their client’s babies.
